## Overview
Dog Breed Prediction is a machine learning project that uses a pre-trained neural network model to predict the breed of a dog from an image. The application is built using [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) for a user-friendly interface.

## Features
- Upload an image of a dog.
- The model predicts the dog breed.
- Supports multiple image formats (png, jpg, jpeg).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or later
- pip (or conda)
- Required packages (see [Installation](#installation))

### Installation
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Dog_breed.git
   cd Dog_breed

2. **Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended):**

   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   # On Windows:
   env\Scripts\activate
   # On Mac/Linux:
   source env/bin/activate
   
**Usage**
**Run the Streamlit App:**
```bash
   streamlit run main_app.py
```
**Upload an Image:**
